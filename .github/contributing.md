# Welcome to the Contribution Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time contributing to our project! Any contribution you give will be reflected in the [app](https://github.com/Sthaynny/habilitacao_quiz) :sparkles:. 

## New contribution guide

For an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Create Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating on pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting Started

Check to see which [types of contributions](https://github.com/Sthaynny/habilitacao_quiz/blob/main/.github/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you detect a problem with the documents, [search if a problem already exists](https://github.com/Sthaynny/habilitacao_quiz/issues?q=is%3Aopen). If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Sthaynny/habilitacao_quiz/issues/issues/new/choose). 

#### Resolve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow your search by using "labels" as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we do not assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes

#### Make changes to the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any document page to make minor changes such as a text, sentence correction, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a PR request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Use GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting Started Using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it for [Fork in repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you are ready to merge them.

- GitHub Codespaces:
  - [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/create a code space) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

4. Create a branch of work and get started with your changes!

### Evaluate your upgrade

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to auto-review to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you are done with your changes, create a Pull Request, also known as a PR.
- Fill out the "Ready for review" template so we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to link PR to issue;
