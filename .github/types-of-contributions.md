# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the GitHub Docs content and site in a variety of ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on docs.github.com! Our small but mighty :muscle: docs team maintains this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off-topic conversations will be closed.

#### :mega: discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you want help troubleshooting PR issues for a doc you are working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/github/docs/discussions).

#### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to locate tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage tag, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't start working on it.

If you have found something in the content or on the website that should be updated, search the open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it is something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We will use the number to have a conversation about the issue you want to resolve.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [PR request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes to our repository.

When we merge these changes, they must be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa: To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo, see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

We cannot accept contributions to the [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference). If you detect an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, please open a question in the [github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/new?template=schema-inaccuracy.md) repository.

#### :question: Support
We are a small team that works hard to keep up with the documentation requirements of an ever-changing product. Unfortunately, we simply cannot help with support questions in this repository. If you have a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please [contact GitHub Support directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Any questions, discussions, or help requests opened here that ask for support will receive information on how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.

If you are having problems with your GitHub account, please contact [Support](https://github.com/Sthaynny/habilitacao_quiz/new/main/.github/contribution.md).


If you find a typo in the policy section of the site, you can open a request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING tab in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
